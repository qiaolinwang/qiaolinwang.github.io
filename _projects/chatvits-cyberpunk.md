ChatVITS Cyberpunk 2077 is a playground for mixing large language models with expressive text-to-speech. The project strings together ChatGPT-style dialogue planning, VITS voice cloning, and character-specific conditioning to produce interactive performances inspired by _Cyberpunk 2077_.

### Highlights

- Automated data curation pipeline for extracting and cleaning voice lines from the game franchise.
- Multi-speaker VITS models fine-tuned with character timbre preservation and prosody control.
- Conversational orchestration that keeps generated story arcs coherent while adapting to user prompts.

### Role

- Developed the dataset preparation scripts and VITS fine-tuning recipes.
- Implemented the interaction manager that bridges GPT prompts with speech generation.
- Released reproducible training and inference notebooks for the community.
